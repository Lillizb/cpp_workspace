hello this is a file 
for replacing s1 and s2.

we want to write a program with cpp98 to realize a function 
which the program will copy the content from file and replace s1 with s2. 


let's say:

This is an apple.
That is an banana.
Those are oranges.

we want to replace the fruits with other things and test the result.
